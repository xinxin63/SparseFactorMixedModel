\title{Sample Eta given B-splines individual-level model}
\usage{
bs_model(Y, data_model_parameters, BSFG_state = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{a vector of observation. Pre-scaled and centered if desired.}

\item{data_model_parameters}{a list including:
\code{observations}, a data.frame with columns: \code{ID} and \code{covariate}, ordered by ID.
and the variables df, knots, degree and intercept.
Empty values will use the defaults for \code{bs()}.}
}
\description{
Eta is a matrix of individual-level parmaters for a B-spline with
   equivalent knots over all individuals
}
\details{
This function should pre-calculate design matrices for each individual (assuming they are all
    unique), as well as SVDs for efficient repeated solvings of the posterior distributions
    as resid_Y_prec, Eta_mean and resid_Eta_prec are updated each iteraction.
