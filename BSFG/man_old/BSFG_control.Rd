\usage{
BSFG_control(sampler = c("fast_BSFG", "general_BSFG"),
  Posterior_folder = "Posterior", fixed_factors = c(T, F),
  simulation = c(F, T), scale_Y = c(T, F), b0 = 1, b1 = 5e-04,
  epsilon = 0.1, prop = 1, k_init = 20, h2_divisions = 100,
  burn = 100, thin = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampler}{specify the sampler to use. fast_BSFG is much faster, but only allows one random
effect. If more are specified in \code{BSFG_init}, this is switched to general_BSFG.}

\item{Posterior_folder}{folder to save posterior sample chunk files}

\item{fixed_factors}{should the fixed effect model be applied to factors as well as the factor
residuals? If so, the first column of the design matrix is dropped.}

\item{simulation}{Is this a fit to simulated data? If so, a setup list will be expected providing
the true values}

\item{scale_Y}{Should the Y values be centered and scaled? Recommend, except for simulated data.}

\item{b0}{parameter of the \code{update_k} function. See Bhattacharya and Dunson 2011}

\item{b1}{parameter of the \code{update_k} function. See Bhattacharya and Dunson 2011}

\item{epsilon}{parameter of the \code{update_k} function. Smallest \eqn{\lambda_{ij}} that is
considered "large", signifying a factor should be kept. See Bhattacharya and Dunson 2011}

\item{prop}{proportion of \eqn{\lambda{ij}} elements in a column of \eqn{\Lambda} that must be smaller than
\code{epsilon} before factor is dropped. See Bhattacharya and Dunson 2011}

\item{h2_divisions}{A scalar or vector of length equal to number of random effects. In BSFG, random
effects are re-scaled as percentages of the total variation. Then a discrete prior spanning [0,1)
with \code{h2_divisions} equally spaced values is constructred for each variance component. If
\code{h2_divisions} is a scalar, the prior for each variance component has this number of divisions.
In the joint prior over all variance components, combinations of variance components with total variance != 1
are assigned a prior of zero and ignored.}

\item{burn}{burnin length of the MCMC chain}

\item{thin}{thinning rate of the MCMC chain}

\item{kinit}{initial number of factors}
